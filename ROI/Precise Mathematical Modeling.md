### Basic Identification
There are 4 basic scenario to apply blockchain on supply chain:
1. The whole blockchain system is deployed in the on-premises environment
2. The whole blockchain system is deployed in cloud environment
3. The blockchain system is deployed in the hybrid: cloud + on-premises environment
4. 2 step: first on-premises, then cloud (a hidden transfer step)

### Variables & Parameters

### Scenario 1: On-premises

For S<sub>θ</sub>:

**Recall scope reduction and faster localization**: Customers can be notified precisely by batch, serial number, time window, or store.

**Higher compliance and audit pass rates**: FSMA/cold chain records, origin and inspection certificates can be verified online.

**Reduction of quality losses**: Source inspections, third-party laboratory tests, and exception handling records can be validated.

**Prevention of adulteration or substitution**: Origin, species/grade, and certificates such as MSC/organic are matched with blockchain fingerprints.

**Cold-chain compliance reduces spoilage**: Store and truck temperature curves and loading/unloading timestamps can be audited and checked by customers.

**Shelf-life and product age transparency reduces forced markdowns**: Batch, production/slaughter/catch date, and shelf placement date are connected.

**Insurance optimization**: Traceability and compliance rates, once validated on-chain, are recognized by insurers and reduce premiums or deductibles.
